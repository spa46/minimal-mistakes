|**Cons**     | measurement accuracy  | Object recognition   | accuracy |
|**Pros**     | environmental factors | measurement accuracy | cost     |


*Laser beam is often used to measure long distance.

### Ultrasonic

Ultrasonic sensors often enhances **distance measurement** to the object very accurately.

### Infrared 

One of the great feature of using infrared sensor thermal emission. This enhances object come and go by thermal emission. However, thermal emission should be taken carefully depends on environmental factors. the sensor only able to detect object within a range but cannot accurately sense distnace.

**Types:**

- Passive infrared sensor: 
	> Senses thermal radiation transferred to infrared.
    
  
- Active infrared distance sensor:
    >Detects returned sent light from infrared. This notifies distance in a range.

**Application:**

> Hand Dryer, Water tab, rubish bin.
